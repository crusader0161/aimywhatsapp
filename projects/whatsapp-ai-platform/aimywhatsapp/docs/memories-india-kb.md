## Quote Calculation Examples

### CD/VCD Conversion
Formula: Quantity × Rs. 400 = Subtotal → apply 20% discount if all CDs work = Final amount

Examples:
- 10 CDs: 10 × 400 = Rs. 4,000 → after 20% discount = Rs. 3,200
- 20 CDs: 20 × 400 = Rs. 8,000 → after 20% discount = Rs. 6,400
- 38 CDs: 38 × 400 = Rs. 15,200 → after 20% discount = Rs. 12,160
- 50 CDs: 50 × 400 = Rs. 20,000 → after 20% discount = Rs. 16,000

Advance payment: 50% of final amount required after pickup
- Advance for 38 CDs: Rs. 6,160 (50% of Rs. 12,160)
- Balance paid on completion/delivery
