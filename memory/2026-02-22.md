# 2026-02-22 — Session Notes

## Shashank Rathore onboarded
- Named me: Zed ⚡
- Location: Delhi, India (IST UTC+5:30)
- New to OpenClaw
- Walked him through Telegram + WhatsApp setup

## Major Project Started: WhatsApp AI Bot Platform ("WaBot")
- Full technical spec written: `/projects/whatsapp-ai-platform/SPEC.md`
- Shashank chose Option C (spec first, then build)
- Approved spec, build starts next

### Project Summary:
- Self-hosted WhatsApp AI automation platform
- Multi-tenant SaaS-ready
- Tech stack: Next.js + Fastify + Baileys + Claude API + Qdrant + PostgreSQL + Redis
- 4 build phases, ~12 weeks total
- Phase 1: MVP (WA connect + AI reply + basic dashboard)

## TODO
- [ ] Shashank to review and approve SPEC.md
- [ ] Start Phase 1 build once spec approved

## Aimywhatsapp Build — FULLY COMPLETE (78 files, committed to git)
- Project path: `/projects/whatsapp-ai-platform/aimywhatsapp/`
- All pages built: inbox, contacts, knowledge base, flow builder, broadcasts, analytics,
  settings (bot/whatsapp/team/webhooks/api-keys), onboarding, contact detail
- Also added: Dockerfile, docker-entrypoint.sh, Makefile, packages/shared types,
  knowledge extractor service, inbox/flow/knowledge layout files
- Committed as: `feat: Aimywhatsapp full-stack build complete (78 files)`

## Shashank's Deployment Request (07:31 UTC)
- Shashank wants a live link or GitHub repo to test the app
- I cannot deploy directly (no Docker, no external hosting credentials)
- Plan: Waiting for his GitHub Personal Access Token (ghp_...) to push the repo
- Once on GitHub → deploy to Railway (free tier, supports PostgreSQL + Redis + Qdrant)
- [ ] PENDING: Shashank to provide GitHub PAT → I push code → he deploys on Railway

## Makefile quick commands:
- `make setup` — first time setup
- `make dev` — start dev servers
- `make db-studio` — Prisma Studio UI
